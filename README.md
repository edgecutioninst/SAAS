### Engineering Highlights

#### Privacy-First Architecture
Unlike standard tutorial projects, VoidVault implements a strict **User Isolation Layer**. Database queries are scoped directly to the Clerk `userId`, preventing horizontal privilege escalation and ensuring that every user's "Vault" remains mathematically private.

#### AI-Gravity Integration
The Social Media Creator tool utilizes Cloudinary’s `g_auto` (gravity auto) parameter. This allows the application to intelligently detect the most interesting area of an image—such as a face or object—and center the crop perfectly for different aspect ratios without manual adjustment.
